# Sealedsecret Provider

The Sealedsecret provider can encrypt secret used by [Bitname Sealed Secret](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets) Kubernetes controller. Unlike many other providers offering similar functionallity this one does not require any dependency on Kubernetes. The resources uses the public certificate to encrypt a secret, this makes it easy to use in a GitOps setting.

## Example Usage

If public certificate is stored in git it can be used for encrypting a secret, and then write secret back to git.

```hcl
data "github_repository_file" "key" {
  repository = "example""
  branch     = "master"
  file       = "keys/test.pem"
}

resource "sealedsecret_raw_secrets" "this" {
  name        = "secret"
  namespace   = "example"
  certificate = data.github_repository_file.key.content
  values      = {
    key = "value"
  }
}
```
